Day 7 - Apis Continued
  1. How i explained REST to my brother
     - htttp tells the browser what protocol to use 
     - it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world
     - REST provides a definition of a resource which is what those things point to
     - a web page is a representation of a resource
     - resources are just concepts
     - urls tell the browser that there is a concept somwhere
     - in most cases a resource has only a single representation
     - machines can use those same portocols to send messages back and forth
     - polymorphism means that a different nouns can habe the same verb applied to them
