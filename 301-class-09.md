Day 9 - Refactoring
  1. Functional Programming Concepts
     - functional programming is a programming paragigm or a style of building the stucture and elements of computer programming
     - a function is pure if it returns the same result given the same arguments and it does not cause any observable side effects
     - if a function reads external files its not a pure function because the files contents can change
     - any function that relies on a random number generator cant be pure
     - an example of an observable side effect is if you modify a global object or a parameter passed by referance
     - mutability is discouraged in functional programming
     - benefits of pure functions are that the code is easier to test and we dont need to mock anything
     - immutability  means unchanging over time or unable to be changed
     - with recursion we keep our variables immutible
     - trim means to remove whitespace from both ends of a string
     - split and join replaces all instances of match with replacement in a givin string
     - the idea of functions as first class entities is that functions are also treated as values and used as data
     - functions as first class entites can refer to it from constants and variables and pass it as a parameter to other functions and return it as a result from other functions
     - a higher order function is that it either takes one or more fucntions as arguments or returns a function as its result
  2. Refactoring Javascirpt for Readability
     - A hash function is used to map a given key to a location in the hash table
     - Maps and sets use a has function under the surface
     - It's easy to tack on addendums about scaling and redundancy.
     - easy ways to implement methods which lead to easier to read code is to return early from functions and cache variables so functions can be read like sentances and check for web apis before implementing your own functionality
     - it is important to get your code right the first time because in many businesses there inst much value in refactoring
