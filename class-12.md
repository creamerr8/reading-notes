1. Chartjs API
   - this artical would not open
2. Basic Usage
   - canvas tags have the attributes width and height, they do not have to used though because they can be set using the dom
   - if there is no width or height set the canvas will initaly be 300px wide and 150 px tall
   - the canvas element can be styled like any other image, these rules however dont affect the actual drawing of the canvas
   - the canvas element differs from an img tag in that it is easy to define fallback content, to be displayed in older older browsers not supporting it
   - providing fallback content is very straightforward just inset the alternant content inside the canvas element 
   - canvas tag requires a closing taag
   - the canvas element creates a fixed size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown
   - the canvas is initaly blank and a script needs to access the rendering context to draw on it
   - getcontext is use to obtain the rendering context 
3. Drawing Shapes With Canvas
   - canvas only supports two primitive shapes, rectangles and paths, all other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths
   - a path is a list of points, connected by segments of lines that can be of different shapes, curved or not
   - the first step to create a path is to call the beginpath, the second is to call the methods that actually specify the paths to be drawn
   - the third and optional step is to call closepath, this method tries to close the shape by drawing a straight line from the current point to the start
   - one ver useful function, which doesnt actually draw, but becomes part of the path itself is the moveto function, you can think of it as lifting a pen or pencil from one spot to the other
   - for drawing straight lines use the lineto method
   - to draw arcs or circles we use the arc or arcto methods
   - the next type of paths available are BÃ©zier curves,, they are availble in both cubic and quadratic varities, they are used to draw compelx or organic shapes
4.  Applying Styles and Colors
    - is you want to apply colors to a shape, there are two important proporties, fillstyle and strokestyle
    - fillstyle is used when filling shapes
    - strokestyle is used to outlineshapes
    - in addition to drawing opaque to the canvas we can also draw semi-transparent shapes using the globalAlpha proporty
    - there are several properties that allow us to style lines
    - linewidth, linecap, miterlimit, getlinedash, setlinedash, linedashoffset
    - just like any normal drawing program we can fill and stroke shapes ysing linear and radial gradients, we create a canvasgradient object by using one of the following methods, fillstyle or strokestyle
    - once we have creates a canvasgradient object we can assign colors to it by usin the addcolorstop method
    - you can use the createpattern method to create patterns
    - using shadows involves using just four properties, shadowoffsetx, shawdowoffsety, shadowblur, shadowcolor
    - when using fill you can optionally provide a fill rule algoritm by which to determine if a point is inside or outside a path and thus it gets filles or not
5. Drawing Text
   - the canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text, filltext and stroketext
   - there are more porperties which let you adjust the way the text gets displayed on the canvas, font, textalign, textbaseline, direction
   - incase you need to obtain more details about the text, the measuetext allows you to measure it
