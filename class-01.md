#### Day 1 - Introductory HTML and JavaScript
  1. Stucture
     - HTML uses elements to describe the structure of pages
     - Tags act like containers . They tell you something about the informationthat lies between their opening and closing tag
     - The terms tags and elements are used interchangeably, but strictly speaking, an element is the opening, closing tags as well as          the content in them
     - Attributes tell us more about elements
     - Attributes appear in the opening tag of an element and have 2 parts (name and value), they are seperated by an equals sign
     - The attribute name is indicates what extra information you are giving about thee contents of the element
     - The attribute value is the information your are setting for the attribute
     - The majority of attributes can only be used on certain elements
     - Everything inside a body element is shown in the browser window
     - Head element appears before the body and it contains information about the page
     - The title element is located inside the head tag and its contents are displayed in the top of the browser right about where you         type in the url
  2. Extra Markup 
     - There are some characters used and reserved by HTML (ex. left and right angle brackets)
     - To us these characters you need to use escape characters/escape codes (ex. left angle bracket &lt)
     - There are also special codes to show symbols such as copyright and trademark
     - When using escaoe characters it is important to check the browser to ensure the correct character is appearing
  3. HTML5 Layout
     - The header and footer tags can be used for contents that appear at the top and bottom of a page or and indiviual artical or              section
     - The nav element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site
     - The artical element acts as a container for any section of a page that can stand alone
     - The aside element has 2 purposes, depending on whether it is inside an artical element or not
     - When an asside element is inside an artical element it should contain info about the artical but not essential to the overall           meaning
     - When an asside element is not inside an artical it acts as a container for content that is related to the whole page
     - The section element groups related content together and typically each section would have its own heading
     - The hgroup element is used to group together a set of one or more h1 through h6 elements so they are treated as one single              heading
     - The figure element can be used to contain any content the is referanced ffrom the main flow of the content
     - The figure element should always contain a figure caption element that provides a text description for the content of the figure
     - The div element is a way to group together related elements
  4. Process and Design 
     - Every website should be designed for the target audience
     - You need to know why people are coming to your website
     - you should be looking for key tasks and motivations for people to come to your website
     - You need to know what information the user needs to rach their goals quickley and efficently
     - You should also have a site map so you can organize your information into sections or pages
     - A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key info that needs to go on each pageof a site
     - Organizing and prioritizing info on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in
     - Most web users dont read the full page, but skim to find info. You can create a vissual hiearchy that gets accross your key              message and helps users find what they are looking for
  5. The ABC of Programming
     - Once you know your goal you can work out the individual tasks needed to complete it 
     - each task can be broken down a sequence of steps
     - In computer programing each physical thing can represented by an object
     - An event i the computers way of saying something happened
     - The code of a method can contain lots of instructions that together represent one task
     - Computers use data to create models of things in the real world. The events, methods, and properties of an object all relate to          eachother.
     - Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrive or update an objects properties
     - Web browsers are built using objects
     - The document object represents the HTML page
     - There are 3 layers to a webpage. The content layer (html), the presentation layer (css), and the behavior layer (javascript)
     - When you want to use javascript with a webpage you need to use the HTML script tag
     - When the browser comes across a script tag it stops to load the script then checks to see if it needs to do anything
