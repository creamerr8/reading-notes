Day 10 - THE CALL STACK
  1. The Call Stack defined on MDN
     - A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions
     - When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
     - Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
     - When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
     - If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.
     - In summary, then, we start with an empty Call Stack. Whenever we invoke a function, it is automatically added to the Call Stack. Once the function has executed all of its code, it is automatically removed from the Call Stack. Ultimately, the Stack is empty again.
  2. Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack
     - The JavaScript engine (which is found in a hosting environment like the browser), is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack
     - The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.
     - At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).
     -  Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.
     - When a function is invoked (called), the function, its parameters, and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a stack frame. This stack frame is a memory location in the stack. The memory is cleared when the function returns as it is pop out of the stack.
     - The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous
     - A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point
  3. JavaScript error messages
     - a referance error is is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.
     - This is also a common thing when using const and let, they are hoisted like var and function but there is a time between the hoisting and being declared so when you try to access them a reference error occurs
     - syntax wrrors occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax
     - range errors is when you manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length
     - type errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.
     - There are also warnings, for instance telling you about a deprecated method, which can be found more frequently in firefox developer tools.
     - The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.
     - You can also add conditional breakpoints by right-clicking a previous set breakpoint, which will make your program stop at that point only if a condition is met
     - You can run the debugger by pressing F5 or pressing the green play button.
     - when we do not handle errors properly, meaning that anything after that error will not be executed. To avoid this we usually try to catch the errors so we can gracefully fallback to a default state of our application
     - JS is not a compiled language like Java so your errors will happen at runtime, that means that you can only see whatever is wrong with your code after your run it.
