#### Day 3 HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow
  1. Lists
     - ol creates an ordered list
     - ul creats an unordered list
     - each item in the list is placed in an opening and closing li tag (list item)
     - you can put a second list indside a li tag to create a sublist
  2. Boxes
     - every box has three availible properties that can be adjusted to control its apperance (border, margin, padding)
     - the padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding space between items
     - css treats each html element as if it has its own box
     - you can use css to control the dimensions of a box
     - it is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties
     - block level boxes can be made into inline boxes and inline boxes can be made into block boxes
     - legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containg text and the leading
  3. Decisions and Loops
     - a switch statement starts with a varible called a switch value
     - loops check a conditioin and if it returns true the code block will run, then the condition will be checked again and it it returns        true the code will run again, until it returns false
     - if you need to run code a specific number of times then use a for loop
     - if you do not know how many times the code will run use a while loop
     - the do while loop is very similar to the while loop except it will run the code at least once
     - a for loop uses a counter as a condition
     - all values evaluate to eaither truthy or falsey
