#### Day 2
  1. Text
     - HTML has 6 levels of headings (ex. h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)
     - H1 is used for headings
     - to create a paragraph you use the p tag
     - use the b tag on text that is inside a p tag will make the text appear bold
     - use the i tag on text inside a p tag to make the text itailic
     - The sup element is used to contain charcters the should be superscript
     - The sub element is used to contain characters that should be subscript
     - The br tag creates a kine break 
     - the hr tag creates a break in themes
     - The strong element indicates the content has strong importance
     - The em element imdicates emphisis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentance
     - The blockquote element is for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph
     - The q element is used for shorter quotes
     - The abbr element is used for abbriviations
     - The cite element is used to cite where information is from
     - The dfn element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term

  2. Introduction to CSS
     - A css rule has two parts: a selector and a declaration
     - CSS declarations are made up of two parts: a property and a value
     - Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements
  3. Basic JavaScript Instuctions
     - Var is what programmers call a keyword
     - Var defines a variable
     - Once you define a variable you can tell it what you want it to store
     - Scripts containe very percise instuctions
     - Arrays are speciale types of variables that store more than one piece of related info
     - JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0 to 9), strings (text), and boolean (true or false)
     - Exprexxions evaluate into a single value
     - Experssions rely on operators to calulate a value
  4. Decisions and Loops
     - There are often times in a script where decisions are  made that determine which lines of code should be run next
     - There are two components to a decision: an expeision is evaluated which returns a value and a conditional satement says what to          do in a given situation
     - You can evaluate a situation by comparinig one value in the script to what you might expect it to be
     - In any condition there is usually one operator and two opperands
     - An opperand does not have to be a single value or variable name, it can also be an experssion
     - Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false 
     - Logical operators allow you to compare the resaults of more than one comparison operator
     - The if statement evaluates (or checks) a condition, if the condition evaluates to true, any statements in the following code            block are exicuted
     - The if else statement checks a condition, if it resolves to true the first code block is executed, if the condition resolves to          false the second code block is run instead
